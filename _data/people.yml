      description: Will is a third-year PhD student in Computer Science advised by Aaron White and [Dan Gildea](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~gildea/). His research interests lie broadly in natural language understanding and information extraction. In recent projects, he has developed [computational models of event structure](http://decomp.io/projects/event-structure/) and has investigated [patterns in lexically-triggered belief and desire inferences](http://megaattitude.io/projects/mega-intensionality/) across the English lexicon.

      description: Ben is a third-year PhD student in Computer Science co-advised by Aaron White and [Lenhart Schubert](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~schubert/). His current research involves creating natural language inference models related to belief and desire properties of verbs (including [modeling annotator disagreement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10501.pdf) in NLI datasets), and he is interested in future applications of these models in plan-based dialogue systems.
